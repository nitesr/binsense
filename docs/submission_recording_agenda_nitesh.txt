Agenda:
- Data analysis
- model research
    num of item classes vs dataset is very high
    prompted for zero/one-shot detection model

- model arch
    OWL is based of CLIP model
    its a zero & one-shot detection model
    tried using one-shot detection (image guided object detection)

    Item Image (I/P) -> VIT (backbone) -> features
    Item Image (I/P) -> VIT (backbone) -> class_head (no query) -> embeddings
    Bin Image, Item embeddings(I/P) -> VIT (backbone) -> class_head (with query) -> logits -> sigmoid -> scores
    Bin Image (I/P) -> VIT (backbone) -> bbox_head -> bbox coords
    Bin Image (I/P) -> VIT (backbone) -> objectness_head -> objectness logits

    B x C X 960 X 960 -> 16 x 16 patch -> 3600 patches / anchor boxes

- data pipeline
    data split -> prepare for upload -> annotate
    download & prepare for train
      -> crop based on segments by max area
      -> generate cropped image embeddings with max IOU
      -> prepare positive & negative queries (image, label, count, query_bbox_coords, all_bbox_coords)
      -> test owl baseline -> train select best checkpoint

- loss & metrics
    - hungarian match anchor to ground truth
    - losses: focal sigmoid, bbox l1 & bbox iou
    - metrics:  confusion matrix, match accuracy by counts

- model training
    - could't complete for OWL 

- model inference
  - react webapp (add product to cart -> select bin image -> check the results)
  - fast api for Restful API

- deploy pipeline
    bundle react webap
    package bundle and fast api
    mount best model, item embeddings, product list
    deploy to ec2

- mlops
   - dvc for data version and pipeline
   - cml (iterative/cml) with github actions for CI/CD
   - aws cloudformation with github actions to provision / deprovision resources

- model monitoring
  - couldn't complete
